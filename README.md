# Campaign Monitoring Dashboard

A professional and interactive React + TypeScript application for monitoring campaigns, creating and scheduling campaigns with real-time updates, and user-friendly forms.

## Features

- üìä **Campaign Monitoring**: View the success rate, and failures of campaigns in real-time.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Campaign Creation**: Intuitive form supporting campaign name, message content, recipient list (email input), category selection, and scheduling.
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Updates**: Get live updates using WebSockets.
- üé® **Modern UI**: Built with `React`, `TailwindCSS` (with `tw-` prefix), and `lucide-react`.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Formik
- **Date & Time**: `react-aria-components`
- **Forms**: Formik & Yup Validation
- **Email Input**: `react-select` for recipient email management
- **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.io

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/campaign-dashboard.git
   cd campaign-dashboard (for backend)
   cd campaign-dashboard/frontend (for frontend)
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   
3. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run backend (for backend)
  npm run dev (for frontend)
```

### Architecture

### 1. **Frontend**
The frontend is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, with **TailwindCSS** for styling. The application architecture follows a component-driven development approach, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

#### Key Features:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: 
  - Reusable components like `CampaignForm`, `MetricsCard`, and `DatePicker` allow modular development and simplify maintenance.
- **State Management**: 
  - Local component states are managed with Zustand React's `useState` and `Formik` for form state management.
- **Real-Time Updates**: 
  - WebSocket (`socket.io-client`) integration enables real-time campaign metric updates without page reloads.
- **Validation Layer**: 
  - Form validations are implemented using `Yup`, ensuring accurate and secure data input.

---

### 2. **Backend Integration**
The frontend communicates with the backend API for the following operations:
- **Fetching Campaign Metrics**: 
  - Uses RESTful endpoints to retrieve metrics based on a date range.
- **Form Submission**: 
  - Submits campaign details to the backend for processing and scheduling.
- **Real-Time Updates**: 
  - Listens for WebSocket events (`campaign-update`) to receive live updates on campaign status.

#### API Communication:
- API calls are abstracted using a centralized utility function.

### 3. **WebSocket Integration**
- **Socket Events**:
  - Listens to `campaign-update` events to dynamically update campaign metrics.
- **Event Handling**:
  - Campaign metrics are updated locally with minimal re-renders using React's `useState`.

---

### 4. **Form Management**
- **Formik**:
  - Manages form state, submission, and validation seamlessly.
- **Yup Validation**:
  - Ensures fields like campaign name, message content, recipient list, and schedule time are validated before submission.

---

### 5. **UI/UX**
- **TailwindCSS**:
  - Custom utility classes (prefixed with `tw-`) ensure a consistent and modern UI design.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Layouts are optimized for all screen sizes using responsive grid and flexbox utilities.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Buttons, dropdowns (`react-tagify`), and progress bars enhance user experience.

---

### 6. **Scalability**
This architecture is designed for scalability with the following considerations:
- **Component Reusability**:
  - Components like `MetricsCard` and `CampaignForm` can be extended or reused across different parts of the application.
- **Socket-Based Real-Time Updates**:
  - Efficient event-driven architecture for real-time metrics without polling.
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**:
  - API communication, state management, and UI rendering are well-isolated, ensuring maintainability.
